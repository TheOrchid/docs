###Components

The platform is provided in the form of a package, you can easily integrate it as a third-party component using Composer

### How to read the documentation

If you are a beginner, then I recommend that you read the `Laravel` documentation from start to finish.
If you are already familiar with Laravel, you can instead go directly to the appropriate section.

This documentation begins with an explanation of the concept and architecture of Orchid before deepening into specific topics.
